These fake domains are designed to exploit common typing errors or misspellings that users might make when entering a web address.</p><p>The goal of typosquatters is often to capitalize on user mistakes by directing them to their websites instead of the intended ones. Once on these fake sites, users may encounter malicious content, such as phishing scams, malware downloads, or counterfeit goods.</p><p>For example, a typosquatter might register a domain like "gooogle.com" (with an extra 'o') to target users who accidentally add a letter when typing "google.com." The typosquatter's site could mimic the look and feel of the real Google site, potentially tricking users into entering sensitive information or downloading harmful software.</p><h1 class='mb-4'>TypoSquatter Report for "facebook.com"</h1><p><em>This report was generated by TypoSquatter Buster by <a href='https://github.com/kaotickj' target='_blank'>Kaotick Jay</a></em></p><p>Date: 2024-03-20 15:18:36</p><p>Total number of domains checked: 295</p><p>Total number of typosquatters found: 119</p><div class='mt-4'><h2>List of Registered Typosquatter Domains Similar to "facebook.com":<small>(skip to <a href='#notsquat'>Unregistered TypoSquatter Domains</a>)</small></h2><blockquote><p>*** Note: List entries in square brackets (i.e., ['DOMAIN.COM', 'domain.com']) did not return valid whois data, but did return a valid http response indicating a valid domain. This is probably due to a request timeout, and you should run TypoSquatter Buster against the domain again if you want to try populating the whois data again.
